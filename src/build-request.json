      "id": "REQ-16",
      "text": "Create a top-level `README.md` at the repository root suitable for pushing to GitHub, documenting the DarkPattern Shield project in English. The README must include: (1) project overview, (2) key pages/routes and what they do (Home `/`, Subscription Trap Detector `/detector`, Personal Digital Risk Test `/risk-test`, Scam Reporting `/report`, Browser Extension Concept `/extension`), (3) prerequisites (Node, pnpm, DFX), (4) local development run steps for the Internet Computer canister (`dfx start`, `dfx deploy`) and for the React frontend dev server, (5) a brief note explaining authentication via Internet Identity (what the user experiences at a high level), and (6) how to export/download the full source code using the existing export scripts and the exported `README_EXPORT.md` behavior (copied from `frontend/SOURCE_CODE_EXPORT.md`).",

        "A new file `README.md` exists at the repository root (not under `frontend/`).",

        "README.md includes a section listing the app’s main pages and their routes: `/`, `/detector`, `/risk-test`, `/report`, `/extension`.",
        "README.md includes local run instructions that reference using DFX to start the local IC network and deploy canisters, and instructions to run the frontend dev server from the `frontend/` directory.",
        "README.md includes a short, user-facing description of Internet Identity authentication (no third-party auth providers).",
        "README.md includes an export section referencing `frontend/scripts/export-source-code.sh`, `frontend/scripts/export-source-code.ps1`, the `export/` output folder, and that `frontend/SOURCE_CODE_EXPORT.md` is copied into the archive root as `README_EXPORT.md`."
