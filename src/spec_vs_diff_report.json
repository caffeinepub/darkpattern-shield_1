  "summary": "The diff adds export scripts (sh/ps1) that generate an archive containing backend/ and frontend/ plus a limited set of root files, and adds documentation files under frontend/. However, it does not clearly satisfy the requirement for a top-level export documentation file, and the export scripts may omit additional repository/config files beyond the hardcoded list.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-11",
      "requirement": "Produce an exportable, complete copy of the full project source code (backend and frontend) as a single downloadable package, ensuring it includes all files needed to build and run the app locally (including configuration files already present in the project).",
      "reason": "The export scripts only copy `backend/`, `frontend/`, and a small hardcoded list of root files (`dfx.json`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`). The requirement/AC calls for a complete repository export including all project config files that exist in the workspace, and the diff does not show inclusion of other possible root-level files/directories (e.g., package manager/workspace files, CI configs, etc.).",

      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "Add a top-level documentation file that explains how to obtain/export the full source code from the app/project workspace and how to run it locally, using only English user-facing text.",
      "reason": "The added documentation file is located at `frontend/SOURCE_CODE_EXPORT.md`, not at the repository top level as required by the AC (“top-level documentation file”, e.g., `EXPORT.md` or `SOURCE_CODE_EXPORT.md`). The scripts also copy that file into the archive as `README_EXPORT.md`, but that is inside the generated archive—not a committed top-level doc file in the repo.",
