# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Provide a complete, exportable source-code package and clear instructions for exporting and running the project locally.

**Planned changes:**
- Generate a single downloadable package containing the full repository contents (frontend, backend, configuration files, and all assets), preserving folder structure and filenames.
- Add a new top-level English documentation file (e.g., EXPORT.md or SOURCE_CODE_EXPORT.md) explaining how to export the full source code from the workspace and how to run the frontend locally and deploy the Motoko backend locally, including where to find generated static assets.

**User-visible outcome:** The user can download one complete source-code archive of the entire project and follow a top-level guide to export it and run/deploy it locally.
